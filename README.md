# Surfing with Ice Cream

## Overview
---
<p>W. Avy is ready to invest in a surf shack and ice cream parlor in Oahu, Hawaii. To be sure of his investment, he enlisted me to analyze weather data before he made his final decision. I utilized SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask to conduct my research as well as present it to W. Avy and his investment partners. I focused on the months of June and December. </p><br>

## Results

- ### Maximum Temperatures <br>

## Summary

June and December months showed promise for W. Avy's investment. The weather stays rather mild. To add to this point, I continued my analysis by looking at precipitation statistics for those months as well. Please see *Table 2* below. December gets slightly more rain than June, but neither month has shown substantial downpours over the years. <br><br>
